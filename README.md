# WaterWars
An FPS Game with Waterguns built for a Hackathon and a French Project

Made using the FPS example in Unity with some modifications. My first time attempting Unity and making a 3D game. I couldn't really figure it out, so it's incomplete and does not work as intended or have all the features I wanted. But it was an interesting experience. I was trying to do it for a hackathon, but it was a bit of an overcommitment on my part. Afterwards, it somehow ended up part of a French project in grade 12 when I attempted to add more features and I still could not figure it out entirely.
